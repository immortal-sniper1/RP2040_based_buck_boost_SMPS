# RP2040_based_buck_boost_SMPS
 A test build where i want to use a RP2040 MCU in order to controll a SMPS with a buck-boost topology. That is also syncronous in nature. As of now i am not sure how fast it can run and what are the absolute maximum operation parameters. Also I will try to make this project run with FreeRTOS or use PIO in order to free the un used pins for other uses.
